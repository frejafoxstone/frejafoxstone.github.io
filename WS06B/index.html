                    <h2>Neuroscience in a nutshell</h2>
                    <p>Neuroscience delves into the physiological structure and function of the brain and nervous system. With around a hundred billion neurons, the challenge is to map the intricate networks that process thoughts and behaviors, revealing the brain's adaptability through neuroplasticity. This field combines biology and chemistry to explore issues like pain perception and diseases such as Parkinson's, utilizing tools like computer simulations and brain imaging to learn about the brain's complex anatomy and its connections to the mind and body.</p>

                    <h2>Cognitive Science in a nutshell</h2>
                    <p>Cognitive Science is an interdisciplinary field focused on understanding the information processes of the mind, investigating aspects such as perception, action, language, and memory. Cognitive Science also examines mental representations, compares human and artificial intelligence, and explores the biological foundations of cognition. This field applies disciplines like philosophy, neuroscience, and anthropology to comprehend how the mind and brain work together, aiming to improve areas like education and technology through insights into intelligence and behavior.</p>
