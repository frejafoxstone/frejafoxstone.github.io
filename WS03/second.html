                    <p>Cognitive Neuroscience is an integration of Cognitive Science and Neuroscience, studying how cognitive functions emerge from neural activity. There is ongoing debate about how the brain is organized: some argue for specific processing regions, while others suggest contributions to a distributed process. Methods such as lesion studies, neural activity recordings, brain imaging, and computational models are used to study these processes. These methods, developed in the 1980s and 1990s, continue to deepen our understanding of how brain signals shape perception, memory, and reasoning, revealing insights into how knowledge is represented and utilized in the brain for thinking and behavior.</p>

                    <h2>Methods in Cognitive Neuroscience</h2>
                    <p>So, summarized, Cognitive Neuroscience aims to uncover how cognitive processes are carried out in the brain, investigating two main ideas: functional specialization and functional integration. The former suggests that specific brain areas are dedicated to distinct cognitive functions, while the latter proposes that interactions among brain regions create cognitive abilities. Initially, brain-behavior relationships were studied through observation of individuals with focal brain damage, leading to the concept of functional specialization. Advancements like structural brain imaging, such as CT and MRI, provided clearer anatomical understanding of cognitive deficits after brain injury without relying on autopsies. Functional neuroimaging techniques like SPECT, PET, fMRI, and MEG allow researchers to observe brain activity during cognitive tasks, linking specific brain regions to behaviors. These methods, especially fMRI, are extensively used to understand cognitive processes, with ongoing developments in combining these techniques to better explore the possibilities of Cognitive Neuroscience.</p>
